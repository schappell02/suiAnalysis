Content Warning: direct reference to suicidal thoughts and attempts.

In this repository, I analyze suicidal thoughts/attempts and their potential correlations with other factors, using the National Survey on Drug and Heatlh, 2017 version, obtained from the SAMHDA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive).

Data used can be found at SAMHDA, after agreeing to their data use terms.
